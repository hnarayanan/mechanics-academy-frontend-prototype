    <h3>The vision</h3>
    <p>Mechanics Academy is an online resource for anyone interested in learning mechanics. The project aims to use interactive, application-relevant simulations to engage and teach students an exciting blend of mechanics, applied mathematics and computational science.</p>
    <p>The overarching goals of the project are to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Attract learners to the rich and useful topic of mechanics</li>
      <li>Act as a catalogue of high-quality learning resources for mechanics</li>
      <li>Offer help and support to mechanics learners</li>
      <li>Provide mechanisms to test learning and gauge competency</li>
      <li>Serve as a conduit between a community with mechanics-related competency and the industry</li>
      <li>Provide scientific computing services on the cloud for easy access to powerful computational mechanics tools</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The team behind Mechanics Academy is working hard on realising this vision. If you believe in the goals of the project, <%= link_to 'consider joining us', '/contribute.html' %>!</p>

    <h3>The underlying technology</h3>
    <p>Mechanics Academy consists of two primary technologies. The first is Django-based a system that offers a selection of <a href="http://thinkbot.net/">scientific computing software as a service</a>.</p>
    <div class="flex-video widescreen"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ey-jSRveWJQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
    <p>The second is a Ruby on Rails-based web app that employs this compute service. It presents application-relevant mechanics simulations to students along with more traditional learning material. As you can probably tell, we&#8217;re busy <a href="https://github.com/hnarayanan/mechnicsacademy-design-docs/blob/master/design.rst">architecting</a> and prototyping this app at the moment.</p>
