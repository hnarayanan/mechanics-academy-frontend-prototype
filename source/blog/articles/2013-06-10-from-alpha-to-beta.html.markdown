Today, I'm proud to announce that Mechanics Academy has grown up from
being a simple HTML prototype to a full-fledged web application. The
site now serves as a fairly sophisticated content management system
that allows me (and anyone interested!) to [catalogue](/library/)
original learning material alongside existing Open Educational
Resources of high quality. Internally, all this material is stored
with a fairly rich collection of metadata, and I'm experimenting with
ways of presenting the content so that it's most useful for students.

For now, all the content on the site is broadly classified across a
handful of subjects,

<p class="text-center"><a href="/library/"><img src="/assets/img/blog/subject-examples.png" alt="A couple of example subjects"></a></p>

and within each subject, the material is arranged in a manner so as to
first provide students with material that motivates them to learn,
followed by more comprehensive resources for deeper dives.

A big part of the catalogue---the raison d'Ãªtre of Mechanics Academy as
it were---revolves around simulation-based demonstrations and exercises.
The technology for this is humming along quite nicely, and I finally
have [a demo](/demo/thinkbot-api/) to share that might be very
interesting for the scientific computing nerds in the audience.

Do [try it out](/demo/thinkbot-api/) and let me know what you think!

With all this new infrastructure in place, I am now turning my focus
to two big tasks. One, to actually start filling out the library with
interesting material that's already out there on the web. (I would
love for your help if you can spare the time.) And secondly, I've
figured out some recording technology that I am happy with, and I'm in
the process of planning and recording lectures as well as dreaming up
programming exercises for my [first complete
course](/library/course/nonlinear-elasticity/).

Stay tuned for all this and more!
