Over these past few days, the site has crossed a tipping point. I am finally satisfied with the basic functionality that it offers, and my attention is starting to turn toward the actual content. (Which isn't to say that my [to-do list](http://mechanicsacademy.org/meta/ideas/notes/todo) is disappearing anytime soon, just that the things remaining on it do not hamper basic functioning of the site.)

And so, I went through my bookshelf and grabbed everything I could find that was even remotely related to my first course on [continuum mechanics](http://mechanicsacademy.org/continuum-mechanics/) and started devising a lecture plan. My current approach is quite straightforward. I've pronounced the most well-rounded book in the set I have access to--Nonlinear Solid Mechanics: A Continuum Approach for Engineering by Gerhard A. Holzapfel--as the _text book_ for the course. And I intend on introducing lectures on topics in roughly the same order as they are presented in the book. While preparing notes for the lectures and thinking up exercises, I will refer to the other books too and try to amalgamate interesting tidbits into a coherent story.

I am excited to start this, but I believe it's going to take quite a bit more time than I originally anticipated. But that's how these things often go.
