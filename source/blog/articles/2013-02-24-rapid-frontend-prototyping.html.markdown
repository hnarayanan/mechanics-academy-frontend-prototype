I feel like I'm making quick progress designing the front-end of this
iteration of Mechanics Academy. Today, I worked out a simple-yet-slick
interface for <a data-toggle="modal" href="#modal-signup">signing
up</a> and logging into the site, as well as a dashboard showing
relevant information to students once they've logged in:

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/dashboard.png" alt="A student dashboard" class="img-polaroid"></p>

The tools that are making this process as easy as pie are the powerful
[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap) framework and
[Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), a modern static website
generator. If you're interested in exploring a new way to create your
next prototype, I can heartily suggest this powerful duo.
