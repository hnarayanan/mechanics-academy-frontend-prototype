Much has happened since I first started working on Mechanics
Academy all those months ago. No longer just an abstract vision in my
head, the project now has [clearly defined
goals](https://github.com/hnarayanan/mechnicsacademy-design-docs/blob/master/design.rst)
which I am using to drive its design and development.

And that's where this new prototype---the site you're now on---comes
in. Exercising all that I've picked up recently from courses on
[modern web development](https://www.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS169.1x/2012_Fall/about)
and [user experience design](https://www.coursera.org/course/hci), I'm
starting to systematically build a sophisticated web app that will:

* Deliver a selection of scientific computing software as a service, and
* Be used by folk to engage and teach students concepts in
  computational science.

I will be posting details of my progress on this blog. Both to let you
know what is going on---and to keep me honest.
