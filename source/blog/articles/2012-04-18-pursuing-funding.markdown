Though little has changed on the surface of Mechanics Academy, a lot has been going on over the past month. I've been waking up earlier and earlier, my brain swarming with new ideas for the project. And I've been going to sleep later and later, as I spend each evening racing the clock to try the ideas out.

In the midst of all this, I arrived at a conclusion: I don't just want to work on this project in my spare time, I want to work on it all the time. So, over the next months, I plan on spending my spare time trying to do just one thing: trying to get someone to invest in the project, either as a commercial entity or as an online extension of their academic outreach. I am nervously-excitedly hoping that something will pan out.

In subsequent posts, I will be sharing my ideas on this, along with my thoughts on the state of online learning initiatives in general. Stay tuned to find out more.
