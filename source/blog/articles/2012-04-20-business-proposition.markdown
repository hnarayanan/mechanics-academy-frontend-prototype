As part of my efforts to get Mechanics Academy funded, I recently gave a version of the following talk to a group of potential investors (the commercialisation division of my employer!). I decided to record and upload a version of it, so that it can reach a wider audience. In this video, I begin with an overview of the current state of online learning initiatives. I then share my vision for Mechanics Academy and describe where it fits in the online education space. Finally, I conclude a business case for the project.

Please get in touch with me if you are interested in supporting the site. I'd be delighted to hear from you!

Sometime soon, I intend on creating another version of this talk where I present a value proposition for Mechanics Academy purely as an endeavour in education. I'll publish it on this blog as soon as it's ready.
