I was really looking forward to the winter vacation. I hoped that the
time off from actual work would allow me to focus in earnest on this
web site. And so, I excitedly packed some of my books and notes
alongside my swimming trunks for my recent Asian vacation. Sadly, it
soon dawned on me that it's near impossible to spend time with family
and gallivant across Asia---all while simultaneously getting work
done.

But this time away has been good for me. It is through meeting people
and evangelising my efforts here that has crystallised in my mind the
direction I want to take this project. Diverting from my initial
plans, I am not going to concentrate on relatively basic subject
matter that has broad appeal to university-level mechanics
students. (A casual search will show that there are several resources
of high quality for such topics around the web.) Instead, I now
believe that I can make a more valuable contribution by educating
interested students on advanced topics close to my area of expertise:
computational biomechanics. And so, I have [outlined such a
course](/library/course/nonlinear-elasticity/),
identified something approximating a text book, and I'm in the process
of preparing detailed notes for the individual lectures.

A basic theme of the course is best captured by the following [TED
talk on mathematics
education](http://www.ted.com/talks/conrad_wolfram_teaching_kids_real_math_with_computers.html)
by Conrad Wolfram. By offloading much of the tedium of classical
mechanics formulation and calculation to the computer, we free our
minds both to gain deeper theoretical insight _and_ build the capacity
to address the complexities of biomechanics problems of practical
importance.
