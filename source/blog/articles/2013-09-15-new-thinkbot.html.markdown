Today, I'm proud to announce a brand new website for [thinkbot](https://thinkbot.net), the compute service underlying Mechanics Academy. This new website tries to better motivate the features offered by the service, [documents how to use it](https://thinkbot.net/docs/) and tries to [gather support for its further development](https://thinkbot.net/sponsor-features/).

Do check it out, and please spread the word to those who might be interested!
