After going through many different kinds of video lectures online, I'd concluded that I wanted to model my lectures after [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/). That is, I intend on recording myself casually writing things out on screen along with accompanying audio explanations. If you've ever watched a video on that site, you know what I mean.

A quick look into [how he creates his videos](http://www.khanacademy.org/about/faq#equipment) gave me an excuse to do something I've always wanted to: buy myself a tablet! And so, a couple of days ago, I extricated myself from my little cave of a workroom and trudged down to the nearest Apple store looking for one. After plenty of in-store research, I decided to buy a [Wacom Bamboo Fun Pen and Touch Tablet](http://www.wacom.eu/index2.asp?pid=294&spid=4) (Small).

While I think this company needs a lesson or two on the importance of succinct branding, I really like the device. It came in elegant packaging—vaguely reminiscent of an Apple product—along with a CD for installing necessary drivers and some accompanying software. I popped the CD in and it launched the cutest software installer I've ever seen. Which promptly crashed, and failed to install properly. It miraculously worked upon rebooting my computer though, and I was soon excitedly plugging in the tablet and ready to play.

I really struggled to get a hang of it initially, as using a tablet is an awkward hybrid between using a normal pen and using a computer mouse. Fighting the disillusionment that was setting in, I continued to play around with it and, by the end of the evening, was delighted. The thingy on screen was faithfully and fluently reproducing the movements of my hand!

Over these past couple of days, I've been recording some short videos to test things out. I still need to figure out many more things, but I think I am one step closer to actually recording the first lectures.

Of course, the huge step that's still in the way is to actually plan the lectures themselves. I hope to get started on that planning shortly, just as soon as I can tear myself away from the ever-growing list of ideas I'd like to work on for the site itself.
