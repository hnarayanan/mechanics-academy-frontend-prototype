The funding quest for Mechanics Academy has been hard work and I have little to show for it thus far. But in the process of gathering information to prepare related documents, I've had to read a lot about the current state of online education.

From all this reading was born my latest (sub)venture, [Wisdemy](http://wisdemy.com), where I post news and analysis on the rapidly-evolving world of technology-enhanced education.

I hope you enjoy reading it while you wait for content here.
