I spent a couple of hours this afternoon talking to the fine folks
[Studix](http://studix.com/), a young company working on some
interesting technology for recording, contextualising and presenting
educational material in quantitative fields. In particular, we
discussed ideas to incorporate Mechanics Academy's simulation-based
approach to science education with their HTML5/JS-based recording
system.

This conversation prompted me to create something I've been meaning to
for some time: a mechanics demo aimed at high school kids. So without
further ado, I present to you a simple projectile motion demo:

So, how far can you toss the rock?
