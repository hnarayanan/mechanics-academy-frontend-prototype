After finally working through a round of grant applications and talks,
I've had a couple of days to really sit down and work on ideas for
Mechanics Academy. Here is a look at how the interactive demo
functionality (which will be the basis for exercises) is shaping up.

All that I've picked up from the [Software as a
Service](https://www.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS169.1x/2012_Fall/about)
and [Computer
Graphics](https://www.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS184.1x/2012_Fall/about)
classes from BerkeleyX are being put to good use!
