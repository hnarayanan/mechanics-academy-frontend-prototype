I love to teach. I greatly enjoy making websites. I don't know why it
took me so long to connect these dots, but from that recent connection
was born _Mechanics Academy_.

Mechanics Academy is a website for disseminating university-level
lectures on topics I care about. These primarily include continuum
mechanics theory, its application to mathematical biology and the
numerical methods involved in solving the equations arising from the
theory. The effort is greatly inspired by how much I've learnt from
other virtual learning projects around the web. Prominent examples of
these are [Khan Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/), MIT's
[OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/) and Stanford's [iPhone
Application
Development](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/drupal/),
[Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ai-class.com/) and [Machine
Learning](http://www.ml-class.org/) classes. Each of these projects
serve their respective niches very well, and Mechanics Academy hopes
to be a similarly valuable resource for university students aiming to
learn mechanics.

From the instant the idea popped into my head about ten days ago, I
have spent nearly every moment of my spare time working on it. My
early efforts have focussed entirely on getting the site up and
running. After spending a few hours toying with different potential
domain names, I started to think about what kind of content the site
should house and how it should be organised.

  <div class="col-sm-6">

  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <img class="img-thumbnail" src="/assets/img/blog/content-graph.jpg">
    <p class="caption">Graph of the site content</p>
  </div>
</div>

In a couple of days, I was happy with the basic structure of the
content and started to delve deeper into implementational
aspects. This has been the focus of my efforts this past week. In that
time, I've gone from a few simple sketches of how I'd like the site to
look and behave to a reasonably-working implementation in
[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) using custom post-types and
taxonomies to store the lectures. On that note, the source code that
powers this site is available, in case you are interested in
downloading it for your own needs or contributing to this
project. Please let me know if you are interested.

  </div>
</div>

Now that the basic site functionality is in place, I'm starting to
focus my attention on generating content. Along with video lectures,
the site also aims to contain related lecture notes, practice
exercises and avenues to get additional help. More updates on all of
this soon, after I've given myself some time to plan the lectures for
the first course on [continuum
mechanics](http://mechanicsacademy.com/library/course/nonlinear-elasticity/).

For now, I'd like to thank you for your interest in this project and
welcome you to it. I hope you find your stay pleasant, and that you
have fun learning!
